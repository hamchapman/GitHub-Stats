GitHub-Stats
============

A small Sinatra app to try out using the GitHub API for various tasks. So far all it does is tell you how many commits a given user made between two dates. 

It was done by just hacking away at it and as such there aren't yet any tests. I will be using this to experiment using webmocks with and will then add in tests for existing code and any future code I add.
